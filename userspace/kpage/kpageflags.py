 * /proc/kpageflags.  This file contains a 64-bit set of flags for each
   page, indexed by PFN.

   The flags are (from fs/proc/page.c, above kpageflags_read):

     0. LOCKED
     1. ERROR
     2. REFERENCED
     3. UPTODATE
     4. DIRTY
     5. LRU
     6. ACTIVE
     7. SLAB
     8. WRITEBACK
     9. RECLAIM
    10. BUDDY
    11. MMAP
    12. ANON
    13. SWAPCACHE
    14. SWAPBACKED
    15. COMPOUND_HEAD
    16. COMPOUND_TAIL
    16. HUGE
    18. UNEVICTABLE
    19. HWPOISON
    20. NOPAGE
    21. KSM

Short descriptions to the page flags:

 0. LOCKED
    page is being locked for exclusive access, eg. by undergoing read/write IO

 7. SLAB
    page is managed by the SLAB/SLOB/SLUB/SLQB kernel memory allocator
    When compound page is used, SLUB/SLQB will only set this flag on the head
    page; SLOB will not flag it at all.

10. BUDDY
    a free memory block managed by the buddy system allocator
    The buddy system organizes free memory in blocks of various orders.
    An order N block has 2^N physically contiguous pages, with the BUDDY flag
    set for and _only_ for the first page.

15. COMPOUND_HEAD
16. COMPOUND_TAIL
    A compound page with order N consists of 2^N physically contiguous pages.
    A compound page with order 2 takes the form of "HTTT", where H donates its
    head page and T donates its tail page(s).  The major consumers of compound
    pages are hugeTLB pages (Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt), the SLUB etc.
    memory allocators and various device drivers. However in this interface,
    only huge/giga pages are made visible to end users.
17. HUGE
    this is an integral part of a HugeTLB page

19. HWPOISON
    hardware detected memory corruption on this page: don't touch the data!

20. NOPAGE
    no page frame exists at the requested address

21. KSM
    identical memory pages dynamically shared between one or more processes

    [IO related page flags]
 1. ERROR     IO error occurred
 3. UPTODATE  page has up-to-date data
              ie. for file backed page: (in-memory data revision >= on-disk one)
 4. DIRTY     page has been written to, hence contains new data
              ie. for file backed page: (in-memory data revision >  on-disk one)
 8. WRITEBACK page is being synced to disk

    [LRU related page flags]
 5. LRU         page is in one of the LRU lists
 6. ACTIVE      page is in the active LRU list
18. UNEVICTABLE page is in the unevictable (non-)LRU list
                It is somehow pinned and not a candidate for LRU page reclaims,
		eg. ramfs pages, shmctl(SHM_LOCK) and mlock() memory segments
 2. REFERENCED  page has been referenced since last LRU list enqueue/requeue
 9. RECLAIM     page will be reclaimed soon after its pageout IO completed
11. MMAP        a memory mapped page
12. ANON        a memory mapped page that is not part of a file
13. SWAPCACHE   page is mapped to swap space, ie. has an associated swap entry
14. SWAPBACKED  page is backed by swap/RAM
